- </b> Fully dynamic (responsive) design with help of bootstrap <br>
- Dynamics in message and animation playback when upgrading an item <br>
- Dynamic Search for Suggested Items according to the introduction <br>
- The Google Charts API has been used to render some of the tables and schematics, leaving some just to keep their place and an example of how they work so you can later use the logic and add what you want.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<b> <span style = "text-decoration: underline"> Planned but NOT implemented </span> </b> <br>
- Quest System / I did not even have a decision on what to do, but there was something in my head that had quests that were only related to the sets (regardless of the options), there were slots in which you could put part of a set and when it is filled to give you a bonus set by the administrator (in the form of an upgrade of one set free or a certain option). Then a new set of quests opens
- Betting Games / I did not think about exactly what games to play on this topic
